## About run_analysis.R 
This is a single R script file that I have created for the purpose of this project. This file automatically loads data.table package. The working directory should be the folder that has "train","test" folders and other files.  
The script is divided in various parts. For more details refer codebook.

To run analysis:
1. Save this file in your present working directory as mentioned above.
2. Type `source("run_analysis.R")`
3. Two data files are created.
